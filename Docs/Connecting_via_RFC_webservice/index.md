## Calling RFC function modules or BAPIs via SOAP web service

There is a possibility to access plain old RFC function modules and even some BAPIs by configuring a SOAP webservice for them. Here is what you will need:

1. [Set up the webserivce in SAP NetWeaver](setting_up_rfc_webservice.md)
2. Set up a data source and a connection in the metamodel
3. [Create actions in the metamodel to call the RFC](Modeling_RFC_actions.md)
